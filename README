SAMPLE CHANGE
===============

We plan to programatically analyse the images provided by tomnod.com to find if airplane parts are visible in the
images.

1. We first plan to find edges in the images, if we find edges, then there is something in the picture that is not a
cloud or water.

2. For the second step, we initially just plan to review the images that have edges manually. If this data set turns out
to be too big, we plan to programatically do something with that set, maybe use a classifier. But our knowledge is
limited and we seek expert help to build such a classifier in a short time. If you can contribute to this, we and the
friends and relatives of the passengers of MH-370 are grateful.

Thank you!
